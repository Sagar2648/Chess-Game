Chess Game Project
Overview
This project is a Python-based chess game application built using Pygame. It allows players to play a two-player chess game with features such as:
Displaying board and pieces.
Highlighting legal moves.
Checking for checkmate and stalemate.
Providing move history (e.g., "Piece moved from e2 to e4").
